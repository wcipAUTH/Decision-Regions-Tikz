# Decision-Regions-Tikz
This repository contains a Matlab script designed to record the coordinates of a constellation and the connections formed by its Voronoi diagram into a .txt file. Additionally, it includes a LaTeX file that employs Tikz to depict the decision regions of various constellations.


The file simulations_ext.m produces the .txt files with the IQ coordinates of the constellations an their Voronoi diagram.

The file data.zip includes some .txt files of various constellation that we produced using simulations_ext.m and you can unzip in order to use it along with main.tex file in order to design in Tikz nice decision regions of your constellation.


The file figure.png illustrates 3 constellatio formats and their decision regions produced by tikz library in latex.
